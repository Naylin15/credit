# Credit Vouchers

This plugin allows you to declare and follow (by entity) the consumptions of different credit vouchers directly from the Ticket form. To do it, you must follow these steps:

* Creation of different types of credit vouchers (as GLPI dropdown);
* Creation, in Entity tab, of the credit vouchers available for these entities;
* Declaration / Modification / Deletion of a consumption in the Ticket form and tab;
* Consultation of the vouchers sold, the remaining credits, credits consumptions from the Ticket form or from Entity tab.
